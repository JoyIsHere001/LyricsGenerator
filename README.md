### LyricsGenerator In C++:

üéµ A C++ console application that animates and displays the lyrics of the song "Dekha Hi Nahi" by Osho Jain. It demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and uses multithreading for text animation.

### Features:

1. animated Lyrics: Lyrics are displayed character by character, simulating a typewriter effect.

2. Song Structure: Includes multiple verses and choruses, organized and played sequentially.

3. Customizable Delay: Animation speed can be adjusted via the printAnimated() function.

4. Pause Between Sections: Automatic delay between song parts for realistic reading experience.

5. Object-Oriented Design: Implements a SongGenerator class for modularity and reuse.


## Requirements: 

- **C++ Compiler** (e.g. [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) or g++)  
- **Windows Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**
